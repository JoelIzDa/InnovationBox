# Azure: InnovationBox
A standardized Azure-based test environment, known as the “Innobox”, is being developed and offered as a service product within an existing enterprise cloud infrastructure. It is designed to provide internal departments with a preconfigured environment for testing purposes, limited to a maximum usage period of six months. This time constraint is defined as an organisational guideline and is included in the service description. It is not technically enforced but serves to clarify that the environment is not intended for long-term or productive use.

The Innobox enables users to evaluate and experiment with various Azure services such as those available through the Azure Marketplace in a secure and isolated environment. The infrastructure is deployed entirely through Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring consistency, automation, and scalability across all deployments.

This offering aims to lower the barrier to entry for cloud adoption by allowing departments to explore Azure technologies in a low-risk setting. At the same time, it reduces the likelihood of costly project failures caused by unmet expectations or insufficient understanding of cloud capabilities.

The test environment is introduced within a complex and growing cloud ecosystem comprising multiple tenants and over 200 Azure subscriptions, expanding at a rate of approximately 100 subscriptions per year. Throughout this landscape, security and compliance are treated as critical priorities, and all solutions are developed in alignment with established governance and regulatory standards.
